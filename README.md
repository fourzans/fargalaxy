In the example above, a prediction for the weather conditions for the next ten days has been made, obtaining the following results:

1) Total drought days: 41 of 3650 days (10 years) - 1.12%
2) Total rainy days: 1187 of 3650 days (10 years) - 32.52%
  a) The maximum day of inestability is going to be the day 72.
3) Period of optimal pressure and temperature conditions: 81 of 3650 days (10 years) - 2.2%
